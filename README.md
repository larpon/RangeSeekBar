# RangeSeekBar

This is an Android View that tries to mimic the behavior of the JQueryUI Slider widget.

RangeSeekBar is a custom view for the Android platform that makes it possible to have a SeekBar with more thumbs on it. The bar can be setup programmatically or via XML for both Horizontal and Vertical usecases. It supports custom drawables for the backgrund, track and thumbs.

The view should work on Android devices from API level 3 and up (Android 1.5).

## Usage
To include this library in your project please refer to Lars Vogel's tutorial on how to use Android libraries with Eclipse:
http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/AndroidLibraryProjects/article.html

Lars explain things better than I ever could. You can include RangeSeekBar as a library source (import it as an Android Library in Eclipse) or you can use it as a .jar library (include by copying one of the release tag .jars to your project's libs/ folder).
